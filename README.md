## Project Status

| Part | Topic | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| I | Dimensional reduction (Lyapunov compactification) | ❌ **Falsified** (symplectic test) |
| II | Gauge Higgs mechanism + causal sets | ❌ **Trivial** (null model) / ⚠️ parameter-dependent |
| III | Spectral dimension (Weyl law) | ⚠️ Real effect, but d_s ≠ 4.0 and not tested for size dependence |
| IV | Independent verification (graph cosmology v1–v7) | ❌ d_s depends on N; dark energy claim is circular |
| V | Resolution (Part IV+ v1–v8) | ❌ **D_corr(E₆) ≈ 3.02; d_s ≈ 4 is a 3D k-NN effect** |
| **VI** | **Fragmentation & Memory Time (v1–v11)** | ⚠️ **Partial**: Naive space emergence falsified, but **Memory Time ($\tau$) discovered** |

### What survives

- **D_corr(E₆) ≈ 3.02:** the E₆ Coxeter orbit occupies a quasi-3D subset of T⁶ (Reproduced and firmly established in Part V and VI).
- **Dimension is a property of the *Set*:** D_corr ≈ 3 depends on the *unordered set* of E₆ frequencies, not their specific algebraic assignment. (Random uniform frequencies yield D_corr ≈ 5.5).
- **The Entropy Paradox:** Fragmentation creates *local order*. The breakup of a space-filling orbit into $N$ localized strings drops the system's Shannon entropy, initiating a thermodynamic Arrow of Time.
- **The Memory Time ($\tau_{E6}$):** Fragmented daughter strings retain structural memory of the E₆ attractor. For $\tau \approx 237$ steps, they maintain significantly lower entropy than null-model strings ($p < 0.0001$).
- Anisotropic Kuramoto synchronization transition (2/6 dims, T_c ≈ 1.4) — non-trivial, reproducible.
- Universal D_KY ≈ 4 plateau in dissipative coupled standard maps across all simple Lie algebras of ranks 4–8.
- Number-theoretic resonances driven by quasi-periodic recurrence on T⁶.

### What is definitively ruled out

- Emergent 4D spacetime from the original SOH formulation.
- **Daughter Convergence:** Fragmented daughter strings do *not* converge back to the 3D monostring orbit (they form a 4D cloud instead).
- E₆ uniqueness for D ≈ 3–4 (all rank-6 algebras, and even *shuffled* E₆ frequencies, give similar D_corr).
- **Kuramoto Equalization:** Subcritical Kuramoto coupling causes trivial spatial collapse rather than generating indistinguishable independent strings.
- Gauge Higgs interpretation (null model with artificial sync gives higher ratio).
- d_s = 4.0 as a fixed spatial dimension (d_s grows with N in chain graphs; grows with k in k-NN graphs).
- **d_s ≈ 4 as evidence of 4D spacetime** (it identifies 3D structures, not 4D).
- Dark energy as geometric inevitability (λ_decay was hand-coded; E₆ irrelevant, p=0.90).

## The Story in 90 Seconds

1. **The idea:** One vibrating entity with 6 internal phases. Phase resonances fold the 1D timeline into multi-dimensional space.
2. **v0 (Gemini):** Built a 150K-node graph. Got D ≈ 6, high clustering, "mass spectrum." Looked amazing.
3. **v1–v4 (Claude):** Introduced E₆ nonlinear dynamics, proper null models. Got **D = 4.025 ± 0.040** — tantalizingly close to our 4D spacetime.
4. **v5–v6:** Discovered D ≈ 4 is not unique to E₆. ALL Lie algebras of rank 6 produce it.
5. **v7 (fatal):** The symplectic (Hamiltonian) version gives D = 2r identically. **The 4D result was an artifact of dissipative dynamics.**
6. **Part II:** Gauge Higgs mechanism falsified by null model (ratio = 22.2 with artificial sync).
7. **Part III & IV:** Spectral dimension d_s depends on graph size $N$. Dark energy model was circular.
8. **Part V (Resolution):** Measured correlation dimension properly. **D_corr(E₆) = 3.02 ≈ D_corr(T³).** The orbit is quasi-3D. d_s ≈ 4 at k=20 is a graph artifact identifying 3D geometries, not 4D spacetime.
9. **Part VI (Fragmentation):** Monostring shatters. Hoped daughters would entangle into space. Found relative phase drift cancels frequencies entirely. Switched to absolute entropy. **Discovered that fragmentation creates order**, and daughters "remember" their E₆ origin for $\tau \approx 237$ steps before thermalizing. The dimension $D \approx 3$ is proven to be a property of the *unordered set* of irrational frequencies.

## Key Results by Part

### Part I: Dimensional Reduction — Falsified
E₆-coupled standard map with Coxeter frequencies at κ = 0.25 produces D_corr = 4.025. However, the symplectic (Hamiltonian) version gives D_KY = 2r identically. The dimensional reduction was an artifact of dissipative dynamics.
📄 [Full paper](paper/monostring_paper_en.md)

### Part II: Gauge Higgs + Causal Sets — Falsified
Edge variance ratio = 12.5 between synchronized and unsynchronized directions. Null model gives ratio = 22.2.
📄 [Full paper](paper/monostring_part2_gauge_causal.md)

### Part III: Spectral Dimension — Real Effect, Not d_s = 4
E₆ synchronization reduces spectral dimension by 37–51% vs null, but d_s = 4.0 is excluded by 95% CI.
📄 [Full paper](paper/monostring_part3_spectral.md)

### Part IV: Independent Verification — d_s Depends on N
d_s scales linearly with graph size N in chain graphs. Dark energy model is circular.
📄 [Full paper](paper/monostring_part4_independent_verification.md)

### Part V: Resolution — D_corr(E₆) ≈ 3, Not 4
The E₆ Coxeter orbit on T⁶ has correlation dimension D_corr = 3.021 ± 0.005. d_s ≈ 4 at k=20 is a k-NN graph effect for 3D structures. The "4D" result identifies the orbit as **3D**, not 4D spacetime.
📄 [Full paper](paper/monostring_part5_resolution.md)

### Part VI: Fragmentation & Memory Time ← NEW
The hypothesis that fragments entangle into emergent space failed (relative phase drift mathematically cancels frequencies). However, using absolute Shannon entropy revealed **The Entropy Paradox**: fragmentation creates *local order*. Daughters remember their E₆ origin for a characteristic time $\tau_{E6} \approx 237$ steps ($p < 0.0001$) before thermalizing. D_corr ≈ 3 is proven to depend on the *unordered set* of irrational frequencies.

## Acknowledgments

This research was conducted as an exercise in AI-assisted theoretical physics. The human author provided the hypothesis and philosophical direction; AI collaborators provided implementations, critical analysis, and falsifying tests.

*In the spirit of Open Science, we have included the `archive_failed_hypotheses/` directory in Part VI. It documents our initial failed attempts to model space via subcritical Kuramoto coupling and relative phase drift, demonstrating precisely how these mechanisms were mathematically falsified before we arrived at the correct absolute entropy metric.*
